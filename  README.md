# Rewards Blockchain  

The current loyalty rewards point system, although notoriously inefficient but
economically useful, can be replaced by a cryptocurrency decentralized application
(dapp) to enhance security and provide a better service to consumers. Adoption into the
system will be easy for both Merchants and Consumers. The RWRD token acts as a
universal currency that can be earned and redeemed with little to no friction on the
merchant. Consumers earn RWRD tokens in multiple ways, such as a percentage "cash
back" (in the form RWRD tokens) for shopping with particular merchants, as well as via
contests, surveys, and other incentives. Consumers can redeem RWRD tokens for
goods and services with participating merchants either online or in store, and
Rewards.com will convert RWRD to fiat currency (e.g. USD, CAD, EUR, et.al .) off-chain
to pay the program provider or merchant. These merchants include the world’s largest
brands such as Jet.com, Groupon, Expedia, Nike, Fossil, Gap, Lacoste, Walmart,
Macy’s, HomeDepot, and 7000 other brands. Finally, democratization of the reward
program and community participation will be incentivized through decentralized voting
contracts that can release new RWRD tokens into the market based on community
proposals.
